# spring-mongo-web-foundations
A bunch of code for building things in a springy way


Would likes:
 - Go deep with mongo and spring data (Spring data Rest looks kinda cool)
 - Task framework for concurrency
      - e.g. fork join query executor
          - Maybe you just async your DAO?
          - Vs fork join blocking operations.
 - FSM - some reference code to remind me how to Spring Finite State Machine again.
 - Play with the Loom
